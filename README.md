Hello! And welcome to my Movie App! This app is for keeping track of your movie collection! You can sort by the type(vhs, dvd, bluray) and the genre(horror, family, etc..). You can also keep track of movies you hated and movies you still need to buy!

To see it in action:

1. Clone the repo

2. In one terminal, cd into the movieapp and NPM START

3. In another terminal cd one step deeper into the API and run  json-server -w database.json -p 5002

4. This will load the app and all the movies already stored in the database

You will be brought to the home page showing popular movies playing now. From there you pick a nav-bar item and start adding movies!
